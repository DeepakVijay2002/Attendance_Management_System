# Attendance_Management_System
This project is a web-based Attendance Management System developed as part of my undergraduate studies (B.Sc. Computer Science) at Arul Anandar College (Autonomous), Madurai. The system was built to streamline student attendance tracking during special classes and programs, allowing students to mark attendance online while faculty can monitor and manage records efficiently. It improves accuracy, reduces manual effort, and ensures reliable data storage for academic purposes.
